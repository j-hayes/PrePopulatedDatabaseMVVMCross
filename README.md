PrePopulatedDatabaseMVVMCross
=============================

A sample app for thouse who want to have a sqlite database on startup MVVMCross

I am currently writing a full tutorial to do this from start to finish. Stay tuned: 

Disclaimer this project works because there were a lot of settings that were set in Visual Studio, Dll's put in place 
etc.

Do not try to just copy the code, it won't work and you will be frustrated.
